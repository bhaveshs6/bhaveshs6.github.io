These questions replace our original, &quot;Can machines think?&quot;</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="700" height="699" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/image-2.png 700w"></figure><p>Although Machine Learning and Statistics have different purpose, traditional Machine Learning algorithms use statistics as their base. One of the first libraries you are introduced to in the world of Data Science using python - scikit-learn, is 100% based on nothing but pure statistics, and there is one thing about statistics: it can only be performed on a limited data. In the world of data lakes and big data, traditional Machine Learning is not used since data keeps coming and it works only on historical data.</p><p>Here comes the role of Deep Learning.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/image-3.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2021/03/image-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Deep Learning is a Machine Learning algorithm that uses networks known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that can solve any kind of requirement. In a statistical approach, accuracy becomes constant after a while but with deep learning accuracy keeps getting better with increase in data.</p><h3 id="what-are-artificial-neural-networks">What are Artificial Neural Networks?</h3><p>We as humans learn from experience.

Based on this, the ones with lesser sales can be put on offer or placed at places most people are likely to check. Products usually purchased together can be put together to save customers&apos; hassle and also to encourage newer customers to buy them together. This helps to prevent a backlog building in the warehouse.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/08/10/how-fashion-retailer-hm-is-betting-on-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data-to-regain-profitability/?sh=305932a65b00">Forbes</a>, <a href="hm.com">H&amp;M</a> are using ANNs to do such things like warehouse management and store layout.</p><p>Abandoning the one size fits all approach, H&amp;M are tailoring the product mix in their stores. For example, one of their stores in the residential &#xD6;stermalm area of Stockholm originally sold basic products for everyone. After analyzing they identified that the majority of the store&#x2019;s clients were women. Consequently, higher-priced items, as well as fashion items, sold far better than children&#x2019;s or men&#x2019;s products. This information helped them change the range of products in many of their stores. As well as reducing the menswear range, they brought in crockery ranges, a flower stall and a coffee shop. </p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-m-pivots-to-big-data-to-spot-next-big-fast-fashion-trends-1525694400">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports</p><blockquote>By going for a more high-end look the store has improved its appeal and sales.</blockquote><p>According to H&amp;M this optimization has helped increase profit margins significantly.</p><p>Feel free to contact on my <a href="linkedin.com/in/bhaveshs6">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Integrating Ansible, Docker & Apache]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Our goal is to create an Ansible playbook to retrieve new container IP and update the inventory to configure webserver inside that container.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="586" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-16.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-16.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/image-16.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/image-16.png 2158w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We begin with writing our ansible configuration file:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>
